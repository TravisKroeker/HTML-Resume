<p>A former neuroscience researcher, I balance an analytical laboratory eye with an open-minded
    sociotechnical perspective nurtured during a master’s degree in Human-Computer Interaction.
    Binding the two is a robust curiosity to understand the minds of people and discover how research
    can fit into a larger narrative used to benefit others through improved process and design.</p>

University of Trento, Italy - March 2021 <br> Cum Laude

<h4>Bachelor's of Neuroscience</h4>
